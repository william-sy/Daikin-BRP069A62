# Daikin Lan Adapter scripts

## Intro

Welcome to the repository for the DAIKIN BRP-BRP069A62.
I moved all the 'old' files to the 'moved' folder. In favour of actually trying
to write a script that will do it all.

## Notes

currently the `main.py` helps you to find your daikin IP adrres based on mDNS.
It only finds 1 ip so if you have multiple heatpumps this might need some adaptation.

## Documentation
This can be found in the `docs` directory
